This is the development version of OpenCalphad, normally updated a few times each month.

The stable version can be downloaded from http://opencalphad.org either as a zip file or as a precompiled setup file for Windows.

OpenCalphad is a free thermodynamic software for calculation of multicomponent equilibria and phase diagrams and for database development.  It has a simple Application Software Interface (OCASI) for integration in simulation software and can calculate equilibria in parallel using OpenMP.
