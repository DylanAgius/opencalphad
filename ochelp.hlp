\section{Introduction}

The OpenCalphad (OC) initiative aims to provide a free high quality
software for thermodynamic calculations, including property and phase
diagrams, assessment of databases and a thermodynamic library for
simulations for inorganic systems i.e.  gases. liquids, alloys and
other materials using many different kinds of models for the phases.
There are three papers published about OC~\cite{15Sun1,15Sun2,16Sun}.
General information about thermodynamic models, calculations and
assessments based on the Calphad technique can be found in the book by
Lukas et al~\cite{07Luk}.  The software is provided free with a GNU
GPL license.

In OC there is also a framework to store different kinds of materials
properties that depend on temperature, pressure and composition when
such properties are related to the phases of the system.  The OC
software can also be used to assess model parameters for such
properties from experimental and theoretical values.

Complimentary (and maybe sometimes contradictory, I am not perfect)
information about the OC software can be found in getting-started.pdf,
news-oc5.pdf and the other parts of the OC documentation.

\section{Some general features}

Oc is operated by commands typed by the user or read from a macro
file.  The command monitor has a menu of command and each of these
usually has sub-menus and finally some questions may be asked like
phase names, a value or an expression.  In most cases a default answer
is provided which can be selected by just pressing the RETURN key or
by typing a comma, ``,'', on the same line as the command.  At all
levels the user should be able to type a ? and get some help, usually
an extract from this manual, sometimes just a menu or examples of
answers.

The different parts of the OC software are documented separately for
each module: thermodynamic models (GTP), equilibrium calculations
(HMS), step/map/plot routines (SMP) and the application software
interface (OCASI/TQ).  OC uses the free numerics packages LAPACK and
BLAS and a free least square routine, LMDIF~cite{lmdif}, developed at
Argonne 1980 for assessments.  For graphics OC generates a command
file which can be plotted with the free GNUPLOT~\cite{gnuplot}
software.  If GNUPLOT is properly installed this is done automatically
by OC.

\subsection{Names and symbols}

There are many symbols and names used in this package.  A symbol or
name MUST start with a letter A-Z.  It usually can contain digits and
the underscore character after the initial letter.  All names are CASE
INSENSITIVE, i.e. fe, FE, fE and Fe is the same.  Some special symbols
are used:

\begin{itemize}
\item /- is used to denote the electron. /+ can be used for a positive
  charge.
\item \# are used to identify composition sets after a phase name or
  sublattice after a constituent name.
\item \& are used in some parameter identifiers to specify the
  constituent for the parameter, like for mobilities, the mobility of
  Fe in the BCC phase is denoted MQ\&FE(BCC).
\end{itemize}

A name of an element is one or two characters, a species maximum 24
characters (note that a species name does not have to be its
stoichiometric formula).  A phase name is 24 characters but can also
have a pre- and suffix 4 characters long and possibly a composition
set number after a hash symbol, \#.

State variable symbols and TP-fun symbols can be 16 characters long.
TP-funs are expressions used to describe the $T$ and $P$ dependence of
model parameters.

For user input it is possible to use abbreviations of names but one
must be careful with names that have the same abbreviation and avoid
names that are abbreviations of another name!

\subsection{Phases, composition sets and phase tuples}

Each phase in a system has a name and a thermodynamic model. The
models are explained in a separate documentation.  The phases can be
entered interactivly or read from a database or a saved file together
with the last calculation.

In some cases a phase can be stable with two ore more different
compositions for example inside miscibility gaps or when the phase has
order/disorder transitions.  In such a case one use a composition set
index to separate these.  The composition set index is appended to the
phase name preceeded by a hash ``\#'' character, like liquid\#2.

Composition sets can be created manually, see the command {\bf AMEND
  PHASE} in section~\ref{sc:amend_phase_cs} or automatically by the
grid minimizer or application software.

The phase tuple has been introduced to have a single index for both
phases and composition sets in application software.  The tuple index
thus contain both the phase number and the composition set index.  The
array of tuple indices is updated internally whenever a new
composition set is created or deleted.

\subsection{The use of wildcards for names}

In many cases one can use an asterix ``*'' as a name and this normally
means ``all''.  For setting status of phases one can use the special
``*S'' for all suspended phase, ``*D'' for all dormant phases.

\subsection{Model parameters}

All data is organized relative to a phase and the phase is identified
by a name.  Each phase can have a different model for the composition
dependence but the way to enter model parameters is the same for all
models.  However, the meaning of a model parameter will depend on the
model of the phase.

Many types of data can be stored as explained in the section on
parameter identifiers.  The parameter also has a constituent
specification explained in the constituent array section and possibly
a degree, the meaning of which is model dependent.

The basic syntax of a parameter is

``identifier'' ( ``phase name'' , ``constituent array'' ; ``degree'' ) ``expression'' ``bib.ref.''

These parts are explained in more detail below.

\subsubsection{Model Parameter Identifiers}\label{sc:paramid}

The OC thermodynamic package can handle any phase property that depend
on $T, P$ and the constitution of the phase using the models
implemented.  It is easy to extend the number of properties by
declaring property identifiers in the source code.  If the parameters
should have an influence on the Gibbs energy (like the Curie
temperature) or a diffusion coefficient (like the mobility) the
necessary code to calculate this must be added.

A list of the model parameter identifiers currently defined can be
obtained by the command {\bf LIST MODEL\_PARAM\_ID}:

\end{verbatim}}

Many of these identifiers have no supporting software implemented, this
is an ongoing project.  The columns T P indicate if the parameter may
depend on $T$ or $P$.  Some identifiers require additional
specification of the constituent and sublattice, like the mobility of
a constituent.  Currently it is not yet clear if mobilities should
depend on the sublattice or not but the notation allows that.

A slightly more detailed explanation of the identifiers are:

\begin{itemize}
\item G, the Gibbs energy parameter for an endmember or an
  interaction.  G(LIQUID,FE;0) is the Gibbs energy for pure liquid Fe.
  Note that the parameter will be used also below the melting
  temperature of Fe for a liquid phase containing Fe.  G(LIQUID,CR,FE;0)
  is the regular parameter for Cr and Fe in the liquid.
\item TC, a parameter for the critical temperature for ferro or
  antiferro magnetic ordering using the Inden model.
\item BMAG, a parameter for the average Bohr magneton number using
  the Inden model.
\item CTA, a parameter for the Curie temperature for ferromagnetic
  ordering using a modified Inden model.
\item NTA, a parameter for the Neel temperature for antiferromagnetic
  ordering using a modified Inden model.
\item IBM\&C, a parameter for the individual Bohr magneton number for
  constituent C using a modified Inden model.  For example
  IBM\&FE(BCC,FE) is the Bohr magneton number for BCC Fe.  The
  identifier IBM\&FE(BCC,CR) means the Bohr magneton number of a
  single Fe atom in BCC Cr.  An identifier IBM\&FE(BCC,CR,FE) can be
  used to decribe the composition dependence of the Bohr magneton
  number for Fe in BCC.
\item THET, a parameter for the Debye or Einstein temperature.
\item MQ\&C, a parameter for the logarithm of the mobility of
  constituent C.
\item RHO, a parameter for the electrical resistivity.
\item MSUS, a parameter for the magnetic susceptibility.
\item G2, a parameter for the two-state liquid model.
\item VISC, a parameter for the viscosity.
\item LPX, a parameter the lattice parameter in X direction.
\item LPY, a parameter the lattice parameter in Y direction.
\item LPZ, a parameter the lattice parameter in Z direction.
\item LPTH, a parameter the angle between lattice directions.
\item EC11, a parameter for the elastic constant C11.
\item EC12, a parameter for the elastic constant C12.
\item EC44, a parameter for the elastic constant C44.
\item FHV, a parameter for the Flory-Huggins volume ratio
\item V0, a parameter for the volume at 298.15~K and 1 bar.
\item VA, a parameter for the integrated thermal expansion.
\item VB, a parameter for the Bulk modulus.
\item LAMB, a parameter for the thermal conductivity.
\end{itemize}

The current value of any of these parameter identifiers can be obtaind
by the command {\bf LIST STATE\_VARIABLE} using the identifier and
appropriate phase and component specifiers, see
section~\ref{sc:list_statevar}.

For details of the meaning of the model identifier refer to the model
documentation.  As already mentioned many of the identifiers, like the
mobility, does not influence the Gibbs energy but as they depend on
the $T, P$ and constitution of the phase it is convenient to model
them in the same way as the thermodynamic data.

\subsubsection{Constituent array and degrees}

A constituent array specifies one or more constituent in each
sublattice.  A constituent must be entered as a species with fixed
stoichiometry.  Between constituents in different sublattices one must
give a colon, ":", between interacting constituents in the same
sublattice one must give a comma, "," or a space.  A constituent array
with exactly one constituent in each sublattice is also called an
``endmember'' as it give the value for a ``compound'' with fixed
stoichiometry.  Constituent arrays with one or more interaction
constituents describe the composition dependence of the property.
Without such parameters the property will vary linearly between the
endmembers.

If there are no sublattices, like in the gas, one just give the phase
and the constituent

G(GAS,C1O2)

If no degree is specified it is assumed to be zero.  For endmembers
the degree must be zero but it may sometimes be useful to specify the
zero in order to distinguish the parameter from the expression for the
calculated value of the property, like the chemical potential of a
component.  In the gas phase one normally assumes there are no
interactions but it is possible to add such parameters.  For an fcc
phase with 4 sublattice for ordering and one for interstitials an
endmember parameter is

G(FCC,AL:NI:NI:NI:VA;0)

This would be the Gibbs energy of an fcc AL1NI3 ordered compound.

An interaction between vacancies and carbon in the austenite is

G(FCC,FE:C,VA;0)

For an interaction parameter one should always specify a degree but
also in this case an omitted degree is interpreted as zero.

\subsubsection{The TPFUN expression and bibliographic reference}\label{sc:tpfun}

The expression for a parameter can be a single value or a function of
$T$ and $P$.  It must start with a low temperature limit, usually
298.15~K and must finish with a high temperature limit.  These
expressions as well as their first an second derivatives will be
calculated by the TP-fun package.  To simplify that there is a strict
syntax for the expression.  A term in the expression is

``numeric value'' * ``name of TP function'' *T** ``power'' *P** ``power'' 

You can construct very complex expression by referring to other
functions.  If ``power'' is zero the corresponding *T** or *P** can be
omitted.  If it is negative it must be surrounded by parenthesis like
(-1).  If it is unity the **1 can be skipped.

Several terms, seperated by signs, forms an expression and it must be
terminated by a semicolon, ``;''.  After the semicolon there must be a
high temperature limit or a breakpoint in temperature.  A breakpoint
must be followed by the letter ``Y'' and then a new expression for
temperatures above the breakpoint.  

{\bf It is the responsability of the database manager to ensure the
  expression is continuous at the breakpoint.  If there are jumps in
  the value at a breakpoint strange things will happen when
  calculating equilibria.}

After the high temperature limit the letter ``N'' must be given
followed by a bibliographic reference for the parameter.  Use the
commands AMEND or ENTER BIBLIOGRAPHIC to give the reference.

{\bf The database manager should always add a bibliographic reference
  even if it is just his or her name and a date.  This avoids people
  to mistake a value inspired by your experience for a carefully
  validated parameter.}

A term can be used inside a natural logarithm, LN, or exponential,
EXP. And the LN or EXP can be multiplied with a term.  On the other
hand you are not allowed to have any parenthesis, except around powers
or arguments to LN and EXP.  A valid expression is

\begin{verbatim}
 298.15 -8856.94+157.48*T-26.908*T*LN(T)+.00189435*T**2
        -1.47721E-06*T**3+139250*T**(-1); 2180 Y 
        -34869.344+344.18*T-50*T*LN(T)-2.88526E+32*T**(-9); 6000 N 91Din
\end{verbatim}

where 91Din is the reference to the SGTE unary database.

\subsection{The reference state of a component}

The values of most thermodynamic data must have a welldefined
reference state.  By default the reference state for the components is
SER (Stable Element Reference) which is the stable state of the
element at 298.15~K and 1~bar.  (NOTE: the default reference state is
defined by the database but today almost all databases have SER as
reference state.)

For each component (also for other components than the elements) one
can specify a phase at a given temperature and pressure as reference
state, see section~\ref{sc:setref}.  The phase must exist for the
component as pure.

A state variable like the chemical potential, MU(O), will refer to the
user defined reference state if set.  To obtain the value for the SER
state one can use a suffix S, i.e. MUS(O) to obtain the chemical
potential refered to SER.

Note that the value of integral properties like Gibbs energy, $G$,
enthalpy, $H$, etc. may have mixed reference states unless all
components have the same phase as reference state.  In order to have
the enthalpy of mixing of a phase all components must have that phase
as reference state.  For the volume, $V$, SER is always used as
reference state unless all components have the same reference state.

\subsection{Macro files}

The macro command is very useful for preparing complex calculations
and to remember how you did them.  A macro file is simplest to create
staring from a log file (created by the {\bf SET LOG} command).  See the
macros directory for examples.

You can insert stops in the macro file with ``@\&'' at the beginning
of a line.  This can be useful to inspect the output.  The macro
continues after pressing the ENTER/RETURN key.  Depending on the
graphical driver you use the program will normally pause after each
plot and you must use the mouse to click on the graphical window to
continue.

You can insert comments in the macro file with ``@\$'' at the beginning
of the comment line.

A macro file should be terminated with the command {\bf SET
  INTERACTIVE} which gives back control to the keyboard (or the
calling macro file) otherwise the program will terminate at the end of
the macro.

Macro files can be nested 5 levels deep.

\subsection{Environment and startup macro file}

The OC program will look for an environment variable called OCHOME and
if it finds this it will look for a file start.OCM which will be
executed before the user gets control.  This can typically be useful
to set some variables like the plot terminals, see
section~\ref{sc:gnuterm}.  If there is no OCHOME environment variable
the current directory will be searched.

If the OCHOME directory has a subdirectory called ``data'' this will
be searched when the user tries to read a TDB file.

\subsection{User interface feedback}

OC has grown organically and although the basic concepts has been
quite clear several of the implementations of these has become rather
confusing.  This will eventually require some cleaning up of the user
interface.

If you like a Graphical User Interface you are welcome to write it.

A central part of any thermodynamic software is the modeling of the
phases.  The new PDB format for databases may help a little with the
specification of the models.  An attempt has been made in this version
to clean up the way a model is specified and used.  At present one
must first ENTER the phase to give a name, basic model, sublattices
and constituents.  The AMEND command is then used to add magnetism, a
disordered fraction set or to use of BCC/FCC permutations.  Previously
some of these things were set by the command SET PHASE ... BIT and
that was not very clear.

Some computational options like for the grid minimizer are also set
with several different commands.  It is useful to have some feedback
from users to organize this better.

\end{tabular}

Many of the commands have ``subcommands'' and usually there is a
default (listed within slashes //) which is selected by pressing
return.  One can type commands and subcommands and other parameters on
the same line if one knows the order, using a comma, ``,'' to select
the default.

\subsection{Options}

There some options that can be set for the whole session or for just a
single command.  The options are identified by a / in front like
/output=myfile.dat.

The options can be specifies directly after a command.  Only a few are
implemented.

\begin{itemize}
\item /OUTPUT={\em file name} open a file and write
\item /APPEND={\em file name} append output to a file, any previous
  content is kept.
\item /ALL apply for all
\item /FORCE override normal restrictions
\item /VERBOSE write information while executing
\item /SILENT do not write anything except fatal error messages
\end{itemize}

\end{tabular}

%--------------------------------
\subsection{{\em amend} All optimizing coefficients}
%\subsection{{AMEND ALL_OPTIM_COEFF}

The values of the optimizing coefficients, see
section~\ref{sc:enterrange} can be rescaled (start values set to
current values) or recovered (current values set to previous start
values).

%--------------------------------
\subsection{{\em amend} Bibliography}
%\subsection{AMEND Bibliography}

The text for bibliographic reference identifier can be amended.  The
reference identifier is case insensitive.

%--------------------------------
\subsection{{\em amend} Components}
%\subsection{AMEND Components}

By default the elements are the components.  This command can set any
orthogonal set of species as components.  The number of components
cannot be changed by this command.  The new components must exist as
species and be orthogonal.

You must use components when setting conditions on amounts, mole
fractions, chemical potentials or activities.  Note that when you have
other components than the elements you may have negative mole
fractions and phase amounts.

%--------------------------------
\subsection{{\em amend} Constitution}
%\subsection{AMEND Constitution}

The program will ask for a phase name and the user can set the amount
and constitution of the phase.  This will be used as initial
constitution for a calculation unless the grid minimizer is used.

%--------------------------------
\subsection{{\em amend} $C_P$ model}
%\subsection{AMEND C_P model}

The low temperature heat capacity model can be amended.  Not
implemented yet.

%--------------------------------
\subsection{{\em amend} Element}
%\subsection{AMEND Element}

The data for the element can be amended, not implemented yet.

%--------------------------------
\subsection{{\em amend} Equilirium}
%\subsection{AMEND Equilirium}

Not sure what could be amended and anyway not implemented.

%--------------------------------
\subsection{{\em amend} General}
%\subsection{AMEND General}

A number of user specific settings for defaults can be made:

\begin{itemize}
\item The name of the system.
\item The level of the user (beginner, frequent user, expert).  This
  may affect the behavior of the program (not implemented yet).
\item If global minimization is allowed or not.
\item If the grid minimizer is allowed to merge gridpoints in the same
  phase after global minimization.
\item If the grid minimizer can automatic create composition sets is
  allowed or not.
\item If redundant composition sets can be deleted automatically after
  an equilibrium calculaion.
\end{itemize}

Note that these and some other general feautures can be changed by the
command {\bf SET BIT GLOBAL}

%--------------------------------
\subsection{{\em amend} Line}
%\subsection{AMEND Line}

After a STEP or MAP command it is possible to give the command LIST
LINE to list all calculated equilibria or AMEND LINE which allows the
user to EXCLUDE lines or INCLUDE lines from the plotting.

%--------------------------------
\subsection{{\em amend} Parameter}
%\subsection{AMEND Parameter}

The possible parameters that can be amended depend on the model of the
phase.  By specifying a parameter the user can change its expression.
This is not yet implemented you must use the command {\bf ENTER
  PARAMETER} to change the parameter expression.

%--------------------------------
\subsection{{\em amend} Phase $<$\em phase$>$}\label{sc:amendph}
%\subsection{AMEND Phase}

You must first specify the phase name and then you can amend some of
the properties of the phase:

%If you want to amend something
%for a composition set you must specify the composition set number
%together with the phase name after a hash character (\#) (like
%liquid\#2).

%.........................
%\subsubsection{AQUEOUS_MODEL}
\subsubsection{{\em amend phase} ... Aqueous\_model}

A model with dilute configurational entropy.  Not implemented yet.

%.........................
%\subsubsection{BCC_permutations}
\subsubsection{{\em amend phase} ... BCC\_permutations}

This is intended for the 4 sublattice CEF model for BCC ordering.  The
BCC tetrahedron is asymmetric which makes it a bit more complicated
than the FCC.  There can be a 5th sublattice with interstitials.

With this model parameters with permutations has to be entered just
once.

%.........................
\subsubsection{{\em amend phase} ... Composition set}\label{sc:amend_phase_cs}
%\subsubsection{AMEND PHASE ... Composition set}

Each phase has by default a single composition set.  If the same phase
can exist as stable (or metastable) with two or more compositions
(miscibility gaps or order/disorder transformations) you may have to
amend the phase by creating additional composition sets.  

Composition sets can also be created automatically by the grid
minimizer during an equilibrium calculation.  In such a case the
composition set will have the suffix \_AUTO,

Composition sets of a phase can be created and deleted.  Phases with
miscibility gaps or which can exist with different chemical ordering
like A2 and B2 must be treated as different composition sets.  The
user can specify a prefix and suffix for the composition set.  Extra
composition sets will always have a suffix \#digit where digit is a
number between 2 and 9.  One cannot have more than 9 composition sets.

The composition set number is given after the phase name and preceeded
by a hash character \#.  In some cases phase tuples are used to
identify a phase and a composition set by a single number.

In some cases it may be interesting to calculate metastable states
inside miscibility gaps and one can prevent the automatic creation of
composition sets by turning off the global minimazation using {\bf
  AMEND GENERAL} or for an individual phase by {\bf SET PHASE ... BIT
  NO\_AUTO\_COMP\_SET}

%.........................
\subsubsection{{\em amend phase} ... Default Constitution}
%\subsubsection{AMEND PHASE ... Default Constitution}

A default constitution of a phase can be set.  This will be used for
the first calculation with the phase and sometimes if there are
convergence problems.  NOTE that if you want to specify a default
constitution for the second or higher composition set of a phase you must
specify the composition set with the phase name!

Depending on the minimizing software used the initial constitution can
be important to find the correct equilibrium if the phase has ordering
or a miscibility gap.

For each constituent you can specify a minimum $>$ or maximum $<$
fraction or give NONE if there are no default.

If a phase has miscibility gaps and the user has created composition
sets with default constitutions the grid minimizer will try to select
the composition set with a composition closest to the default for a
stable phase.

To temporarily set a new constitution of a phase use the command {\bf
  AMEND CONSTITUTION} $<$phase$>$ or {\bf CALCULATE PHASE ... }.

%.........................
\subsubsection{{\em amend phase} ... Disordered fraction sets}
%\subsubsection{AMEND PHASE ... Disordered fraction sets}

For phases with several sublattices the Gibbs energy of the phase can
be divided into two sets of fractions where the second or
``disordered'' set have only one or two sublattice and the fractions
on these represent the sum of fraction on some or all of the first or
``ordered'' set of sublattices.  

This is particularly important for phases with ordering like FCC, BCC
and HCP and for intermediate phases like SIGMA, MU etc.

%.........................
%\subsubsection{AMEND PHASE ... Elastic model 1}
\subsubsection{{\em amend phase} ... Elastic model 1}

A contribution to the Gibbs energy due to elastic strain can be added.
This also requires values of the elastic constants and lattice
parameters, see section~\ref{sc:paramid}.  

There is no code to calculate the elastic energy implemented yet.

%.........................
%\subsubsection{FCC_CVM_TETRADRN}
\subsubsection{{\em amend phase} ... FCC\_CVM\_tetradrn}

This model is intended for the CVM tetrahedron model for FCC and HCP.
Not implemented yet.

%.........................
%\subsubsection{FCC_PERMUTATIONS]
\subsubsection{{\em amend phase} ... FCC\_permutations}

FCC\_PERMUTATIONS is intended for the 4 sublattice CEF model for fcc
ordering.  Setting this bit means that only unique model parameters
needs to be entered, the software will take care of all permutations.
HCP permutations is also handled by this bit as they are identical in
the 4 sublattice model.  There can be a 5th interstitial sublattice.

%.........................
\subsubsection{{\em amend phase} ... Flory\_Huggins model}
%\subsubsection{AMEND PHASE ... FLORY-HUGG_MODEL}

A model when the configurational entropy takes into account that the
constituents have very different size.  Not implemented yet.

%.........................
\subsubsection{{\em amend phase} ... Gaddition}
%\subsubsection{AMEND PHASE ... Gaddition}

The user can add a constant value of the Gibbs energy in Joule per
formula unit to a phase.  This is a simple way to implement a
nucleation barrier.

%.........................
\subsubsection{{\em amend phase} ... Liquid\_2\_stateml}
%\subsubsection{AMEND PHASE ... Liquid\_2\_stateml}

The two-state model for the hear capacity for the undercooled liquids
can be added.  It uses the model\_parameter\_ident {bf G2} listed in
section~\ref{sc:paramid}.

Not implemented yet.

%.........................
\subsubsection{{\em amend phase} ... Low temperature $C_P$ model}
%\subsubsection{{AMEND PHASE ... Low T CP model}

The Einstein and Debye model for heat capactities from 0 to 300~K will
be implemented shortly.

%.........................
\subsubsection{{\em amend phase} ... Magnetic\_Contrib}
%\subsubsection{AMEND PHASE ... Magnetic-Inden}

The Inden-Hillert and the modified Xiong-Inden model for the magnetic
contribution to the Gibbs energy can be set by this command This
depends on model parameters describing the Curie and Neel temperatures
and the Bohr magneton number, as listed in model parameters
identifiers~\ref{sc:paramid}, for the phase.

The Inden-Hillert model is decsribed in \cite{07Luk} and the Xiong
modified model requires separate values of the Curie and Neel
Temperatures and individual Bohr magneton numbers of the constituents
of the phase.

%.........................
%\subsubsection{QUASICHEMICAL}
\subsubsection{{\em amend phase} ... Quasichemical}

There are several quasichemical models for the liquid that only
describes the short range ordering (SRO).  None of them are yet
implemented.

%.........................
\subsubsection{{\em amend phase} ... Quit}
%\subsubsection{AMEND PHASE ... Quit}

Do not amend anything for the phase.

%-------------------------------- end of amend phase
\subsection{{\em amend} Quit}
%\subsection{AMEND Quit}

Do not amend anything (more).

%--------------------------------
\subsection{{\em amend} Species  $<${\em species}$>$}
%\subsection{AMEND Species}

Not implemented yet.

%--------------------------------
\subsection{{\em amend} Symbol $<${\em symbol}$>$}\label{sc:amendsym}
%\subsection{AMEND Symbol}

This command is a bit special.  It is mainly used in assessments to
specify that a particular symbol must not be evaluated except when 
specified explicity, or when calculating a specific equilibrium.

A symbol can refer to another symbol and thus all symbols are normally
evaluated whenever the value of any symbol is requested.  This is to
ensure that all symbol values are consistent and refer to the same
equilibrium.  But in certain cases one wants to enter a symbol that is
only evaluted when referenced explicity and this can be set with this
command.

Another case when one wants to restrict when a symbol is evaluated is
when one wants to compare the value of a thermodynamic property, like
the enthalpy, in two equilibria.  For example if one has experimental
data on the heat difference for a compound at various $T$.  In such a
case the heat content at the reference $T$ can be stored in a symbol,
which is then amended with this command and the equilibrium at which
it should be evaluated is specified.  In all other equilibria the
value of this symbol will then refer to its value at the specified
equilibrium.  See also the documentation on the assessment procedure.

You cannot amend the expression for the symbol.

%--------------------------------
\subsection{{\em amend} Tpfun\_Symbol  $<${\em symbol}$>$}
%\subsection{AMEND Tpfun\_Symbol}

You can replace a TP function with a new expression.

%ALERT: Check that this forces new calculation of all TP functions.

\section{Calculate }
%\section{Calculate }

Different things can be calculated.  The normal thing to calculate is
{\bf equilibrium}, the other things are special.

\begin{tabular}{llll}
 ALL\_EQUILIBRIA &  NO\_GLOBAL & SYMBOL           & WITH\_CHECK\_AFTER\\
 EQUILIBRIUM     &  PHASE      & TPFUN\_SYMBOLS\\
 GLOBAL\_GRIDMIN & QUIT        & TRANSITION\\
\end{tabular}

%--------------------------------
\subsection{{\em calculate} All equilibria}
%\subsection{CALCULATE All equilibria}

Intended for the assessment procedure.  Calculates all equilibria with
non-zero weight as set by the command {\bf SET RANGE}.  It can also be
used for other purposes, for example testing the parallelization.  The
equilibria can be entered by the command {\bf ENTER MANY\_EQUILIB}.

%--------------------------------
\subsection{{\em calculate} Equilibrium}
%\subsection{CALCULATE Equilibrium}

The normal command to calculate the equilibrium of a system for the
current set of conditions and phase status.  You can calculate a
metastable equilibrium if some phases that should be stable have been
set dormant or suspended or if automatic creation of composition sets
is not allowed.  If conditions allow the grid minimizer is used to
find start values unless the grid minimizer is explicitly turned of.

%--------------------------------
\subsection{{\em calculate} Global\_Gridmin}
%\subsection{CALCULATE Global\_Gridmin}

Calculate with the global grid minimizer without using this result as a
start point for the general minimizer.  Used to debug the grid
minimizer.

%--------------------------------
\subsection{{\em calculate} No\_Global}
%\subsection{CALCULATE No\_Global}

Calculate the equilibrium without using a global grid minimizer to
generate start constitutions.  The current equilibrium is used as
start point.  Can be quicker when only small changes of conditions
made since previous calculation and this is how equilibria is
calculated during STEP and MAP.  It means no check of new miscibility
gaps.

%--------------------------------
\subsection{{\em calculate} Phase $<$\em phase$>$}
%\subsection{CALCULATE Phase}

You must provide a phase name, the amount of the phase and if you
should use the current constitution or enter a new.

The Gibbs energy of a phase and possible derivatives and some other
things can be calculated.  Mainly for debugging the implementation of
models.

\subsubsection{{\em calculate phase} ... Only\_G}
%\subsubsection{CALCULATE PHASE ... Only\_G}

The Gibbs energy and all $T$ and $P$ derivatives calculated and listed for
the specified phase for current $T,P$.

\subsubsection{{\em calculate phase} ... G\_and\_dGdy}
%\subsubsection{CALCULATE PHASE ... G\_and\_dGdy}

The Gibbs energy, all $T$ and $P$ derivatives and all first derivatives
with respect to constituents for the specified phase for current $T,P$
are calculated and listed.

\subsubsection{{\em calculate phase} ... All\_Derivatives}
%\subsubsection{CALCULATE PHASE ... All\_Derivatives}

The Gibbs energy, all $T$ and $P$ derivatives and all first and second
derivatives with respect to constituents for the specified phase for
current $T,P$ are calculated and listed.

\subsubsection{{\em calculate phase} ... Constitution\_Adjust}
%\subsubsection{CALCULATE PHASE ... Constitution_adj}

You will be asked to enter a new composition (note NOT the
constitution and default is current) of the phase and this command
will then calculate the Gibbs energy and all chemical potentials.  For
a phase with sublattices the constitution of the phase will be
adjusted to have the minimum Gibbs energy for the given composition.

It is useful when one or more components are parts of several
constituents, for example in a gas or for phases with order/disorder
transitions, in particular when the corresponding subroutine is used
in simulations.

\subsubsection{{\em calculate phase} ... Diffusion\_Coefficients}
%\subsubsection{CALCULATE PHASE ... Diffusion_coeff}

You will be asked to enter a new composition (default is current) of
the phase and this command will then calculate the Darken stability
matrix
\begin{eqnarray*}
  \frac{\partial^2 G}{\partial N_{\rm A}\partial N_{\rm B}}
\end{eqnarray*}
for all components (see the documentation of the minimiser) and also
all mobility values (if there are any).

%--------------------------------
\subsection{{\em calculate} Quit}
%\subsection{CALCULATE Quit}

Do not calculate anything.

%--------------------------------
\subsection{{\em calculate} Symbol}
%\subsection{CALCULATE Symbol}

A state variable symbol or function is calculated using the results
from the last equilibrium or grid minimizer calculation.  It is used
in particular for calculation of ``dot derivatives'' like $H.T$ for
the heat capacity.

If a wildcard, ``*'', is given as name all symbols, except dot
derivatives and symbols that must be specified explicity and those
that should be calculated for another specified equilibria.  See
section~\ref{sc:amendsym}.


%--------------------------------
\subsection{{\em calculate} Tpfun\_Symbols}
%\subsection{CALCULATE Tpfun\_Symbols}

All or a specific TPFUN symbol are calculated for current values of $T$
and $P$.

%--------------------------------
\subsection{{\em calculate} Transition}
%\subsection{CALCULATE Transition}

After calculating an equilibrium you can calculate directly when a
phase will appear or disappear by releasing one of the conditions you
have specified.  Typically this is used to calculate the melting
temperature of an alloy or a solubility limit.  

You specify the phase name and the condition to be released.  The
program will set this phase as FIXED with zero amount and remove the
condition you specified and calculate the equilibrium.  The
calculation may fail if the phase cannot be set stable with zero
amount.  If successful the removed condition will be set to the value
calculated and the phase set stable with zero amount.

%===================================================================
\section{Debug }
%\section{Debug }

Several possibilities to trace calculations will be implemented in
order to find errors.  The only implemented feature is to stop the
program whenever an error occurs.  This is useful to find errors using
macro files so the macro not just goes on doing other things.

\subsection{{\em debug} Elasticity}
%\subsection{DEBUG Elasticity}

Not implemented.

\subsection{{\em debug} Free lists}
%\subsection{DEBUG Free lists}

Only for experts.

\subsection{{\em debug} Stop\_on\_Error}
%\subsection{DEBUG Stop_on_Error}

The program will stop at the command level after printing the error
message if an error has occurred when using macro file.  This should
make it easier to to find errors occurring when running macro files.

However, it is not implemented.

%===================================================================
\section{Delete }
%\section{Delete }

It is quite difficult to delete anything when the data structure is so
involved.  In many cases it may be better to enter the data again
without the data that should be deleted.  But there are a few things
that must occationally be deleted.

\begin{tabular}{llll}
 COMPOSITION\_SET & EQUILIBRIUM &     QUIT    & STEP\_MAP\_RESULTS\\
 ELEMENTS         & PHASE        &    SPECIES\\
\end{tabular}

%------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{{\em delete} Composition set}
%\subsection{DELETE Composition set}

The first composition set of a phase cannot be deleted.  Otherwise
there is usually no problem unless several equilibria are entered
because the composition set must be deleted in all equilibria.
Composition sets are created and deleted during normal equilibrium
calculations to detect miscibility gaps.

%------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{{\em delete} Element}
%\subsection{DELETE Element}

Dangerous and will probably never be implemented.

%------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{{\em delete} Equilibrium}
%\subsection{DELETE Equilibrium}

Dangerous but sometimes necessary.  Done automatically at a second
STEP or MAP command if the user specifies to delete previous results.

%------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{{\em delete} Phase}
%\subsection{DELETE Phase}

Dangerous and will probably never be implemented.

%------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{{\em delete} Quit}
%\subsection{DELETE Quit}

Do not delete anything.

%------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{{\em delete} Species}
%\subsection{DELETE Species}

Not implemented yet and will probably never be.

%------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{{\em delete} Step\_Map\_Results}
%\subsection{DELETE STEP_MAP_RESULTS}

This removes all equilibria and saved equilibria associated with
STEP and MAP commands.  It also deletes the axis.

%===================================================================
\section{Enter }
%\section{Enter }

In most cases data will be read from a database file.  But it is
possible to enter all thermodynamic data interactively.  This should
normally start by entering all elements, then all species (the
elements will automatically also be species) and then the phases.

A species have a fixed stoichiometry and possibly a charge.  The
species are the constituents of the phases.

A phase can have sublattices and various additions like magnetic or
elastic (the latter not implemented yet).  

TPFUN symbols can be used to describe common parts of model
parameters.  See section~\ref{sc:tpfun} for an explation.

Each parameter of a phase is entered separately.  One may use
TPFUN symbols which are already entered.

At present the multicomponent CEF model and the ionic 2-sublattice
liquid model are the only one implemented.  The CEF model includes as
special cases the gas phase, regular solutions with Redlich-Kister
Muggianu model and phases with up to 9 sublattices and magnetic
contributions.

The enter command is also used to enter equilibria for assessments
and some other things.

The subcommands are:

\begin{tabular}{llll}
 BIBLIOGRAPHY      & EQUILIBRIUM      & OPTIMIZE\_COEFF   &  SPECIES\\
 COMMENT           & EXPERIMENT       & PARAMETER        & SYMBOL\\ 
 CONSTITUTION      & GNUPLOT\_TERMINAL & PHASE            & TPFUN\_SYMBOL\\ 
 COPY\_OF\_EQUILIB & MANY\_EQUILIBRIA &  PLOT\_DATA\\
 ELEMENT           & MATERIAL          &  QUIT\\
\end{tabular}

%--------------------------------
\subsection{{\em enter} Bibliography}
%\subsection{ENTER Bibliography}

Each model parameter must have a bibliographic reference to ensure one
can find the origin of its value.  When entering a parameter a
bibliographic reference symbol is given and with this command one can
give a full reference text for that symbol like a published paper, a
report or simply the reason for the value.  The date and name of the
responsible should also be given.

%--------------------------------
\subsection{{\em enter} Comment}
%\subsection{ENTER Comment}

A line of comment text can be added to an equilibrium.  It is
particularly important when entering experimental data to give the
reference to the data.

%--------------------------------
\subsection{{\em enter} Constitution}
%\subsection{ENTER Constitution}

The constitution (fraction of all constituents) of a phase can be
entered.  This is a way to provide start values for an equilibrium
calculation (when not using grid minimizer).  To calculate the Gibbs
energy for a specific phase at a specific constitution use the command
{\bf CALCULATE PHASE}.

%--------------------------------
\subsection{{\em enter} Copy of equilibrium}
%\subsection{ENTER Copy_of_equilib}

This command creates a copy of the current equilibrium with the same
set of conditions and related data.

%--------------------------------
\subsection{{\em enter} Element}
%\subsection{ENTER Element}

The data for an element is entered.  It consists of is symbol, name,
reference state, mass, H298-H0 and S298.  The latter two values are 
never used for any calculation.

%--------------------------------
\subsection{{\em enter} Equilibrium}
%\subsection{ENTER Equilibrium}

One can have several equilibria each with a unique set of conditions
including phase status (dormant, suspended, fix or entered) but all
with the same components and thermodynamic data.  This is useful for
compare different states, to simulate transformations and to assess
model parameters as each experimental or theoretical information
represented as an equilibrium.

All equilibria use the same thermodynamic data but they have an
independent set of conditions and result data structure and they can
be calculated in parallel.

%--------------------------------
\subsection{{\em enter} Experiment}
%\subsection{ENTER Experiment}

This is used for assessments, experimental data can be specified for
an equilibrium.  The experiment is a state variable or symbol which
can be set equal to the experimental value followed by a colon, ``:''
and its uncertainty.

In some cases an experimental value can be an upper or lower limit.
In such cases the ``$>$'' or ``$<$'' can be used.  The value of the
uncertainty will then be interpreted as a penalty factor if the
calculated value is outside the specified limit.

%--------------------------------
\subsection{{\em enter} GNUPLOT Terminal}\label{sc:gnuterm}
%\subsection{ENTER GNUPLOT Terminal}

For plotting OC generates a command file for the
GNUPLOT~\cite{gnuplot} software.  GNUPLOT can be downloaded free for
most OS but depending on your screen and other hardware you may prefer
to specify your prefered set of terminals.  On Windows the defaults
are:

\begin{tabular}{rll}
 1 & SCREEN  & $>$ set terminal wxt size 900,600\\
 2 & PS      & $>$ set terminal postscript color solid\\
 3 & PDF   & $>$ set terminal pdf color solid size 6,4 enhanced fontscale 0.45\\
 4 & GIF     & $>$ set terminal gif\\
\end{tabular}

The text after the $>$ is written on the GNU command file.  You can
change these or add additional terminals.  You can also change these
in the source code (userif/mon6.F90 file) or use a macro file
start.OCM file to set them.

%--------------------------------
\subsection{{\em enter} Many Equilibria}
%\subsection{ENTER MANY_EQUILIBRIA}

This command is intended for adding tables of experimental data of the
same type.  It can also be used for calculation of many equilibria
using the {\bf calculate all} command.  The user first enters a TABLE
HEAD giving the necessary phase status, conditions, experiments etc.
In this ``head'' some values of text can be referred to columns in the
following table using the ``@'' character followed by a digit 1 to 9,
where the digit is the column number.

The prompt for input to the table head is ``table head::''\\ In the
examples below, taken from the parallel2.OCM macro file, user input is
{\bf in bold} and explanations {\em in italics}.

\begin{itemize}
\item By default all phases are suspended so the user must forst specify the
  phases with dormant, entered of fixed status (including amount) like\\
  Table head:: {\bf entered 0 *} {\em all phases should be entered}\\ 
  Table head:: {\bf fix 0 liquid} {\em liquid should be fix with 0 moles}\\ 
  Table head:: {\bf fix 1 @2} {\em the phase in column 2 should be fix
    with 1 moles}

\item The conditions can be given using the @ character to indicate vaules
  that are given in the specified column in table to follow.\\
  Table head:: {\bf condition t=@1 p=1e5 n=1 w(cr)=@3 w(mo)=@4 }

\item Optional calculations of entered symbols\\
  Table head: {\bf calculate cp}

\item Optional listing of state variables\\
  Table head: {\bf list HM tc(bcc)}

\item Optional experimental data\\
  Table head: {\bf experiment x(liquid,cr)=@5:.01, x(bcc,cr)=@6:.02}
      
\item Optional reference state\\
  The reference state for a component can be set.

  Table head: {\bf reference O gas * 1e5}\\ 
  The reference state for the component O will be gas at the current
  $T$ and 1 bar.

\item Optional plot\_data specifying a dataset number and coordinates
  to be plotted and a symbol.  The coordinates can be table columns.
  Use the dataset numbers to have data of the same type together like
  enthalpies, phase diagram data etc.\\
  Table head: {\bf plot 1 @1 @2 5}

\item Optional comment\\
  Table head: {\bf comment experimental data from Kubaschewski 1955}

\item The table head is finished by an empty line or ``table\_start''
\end{itemize}
  
For the rows in the table the user must first provide a unique name
for each equilibrium (that is counted as column 0 (zero)) and values
for all columns referenced in the table head like:\\
Table row: {\bf EQ1 1573 BCC 0.3 0.05 0.12 0.28}\\
Table row: {\bf EQ2 1623 BCC 0.3 0.10 0.18 0.24}\\

The table is finished by an empty line or\\
Table row: {\bf table\_end}

%--------------------------------
\subsection{{\em enter} Material}
%\subsection{ENTER Material}

The user will be asked for a name of the material and possibly a
database.  Then he can give elements and their amount in mass percent
or mole fraction.  Finish with an empty line.  Then he must specify
the temperature and the program will automatically make a calculation
at 1 bar.  For example:

\begin{verbatim}
OC4:enter mat
Database:steel7
Elements: C , MO, V , CR, FE, SI,
Major element or material:fe
Input in mass percent? /Y/:
Input expected in mass percent

First alloying element:c
Mass percent: /1/:
Second alloying element:cr
Mass percent: /1/: 5
Third alloying element:mo
Mass percent: /1/: 8
Next alloying element:v
Mass percent: /1/:
Next alloying element:
 3E reading a TDB file
 3D em:  W%(C)=1  W%(CR)=5  W%(MO)=8  W%(V)=1   N=1
Temperature /1000/:
 3Y Constitution of metastable phases set
 3Y Composition set(s) created:            1
Gridmin:   18846 points   6.25E-02 s and      78 clockcycles, T= 1000.00
Phase change: its/add/remove:     5    0   21
Equilibrium calculation   19 its,   6.2500E-02 s and      94 clockcycles

\end{verbatim}

The user can specify another composition of the same alloy with the
 same command or use other commands like {\bf SET CONDITION} and {\bf
 CALCULATE}

%--------------------------------
\subsection{{\em enter} Optimizing coefficient}
%\subsection{ENTER Optimize coeff}

The TP symbols for the coefficients to be optimized are entered.  They
have the names A00 to A99.  They are used in model parameters and can
be varied by the optimization procedure to minimize the difference
between the experimental data and the same property calculated from
the models of the phases.

%--------------------------------
\subsection{{\em enter} Parameter}
%\subsection{ENTER Parameter}

A model parameter is defined by its identifier, the phase and
constituent array.  A parameter can be a constant or depend on T and
P.  The parameter will be multiplied with the fractions of the
constituents given by its constituent array.  See the documentation of
the GTP model package or the book by Lukas et al\cite{07Luk} for more
information about thermodynamic models.

For example G(LIQUID,CR) is the Gibbs energy of liquid Cr relative to
its reference state, normally the stable state of Cr at 298.15 K and 1
bar, and called an endmember.

For a gas molecule the parameter G(GAS,C1O2) is also an endmember and
represent the Gibbs energy of the C1O2 molecule relative to the
reference states of C (carbon) and O (oxygen).

For interaction parameters the components are separated by a comma
``,'' like in G(LIQUID,CR,FE).

For phases with sublattices the constituents in each sublattice
are separated by a semicolon, ``:'' and interacting constituents in
the same sublattice by a comma, ``,''.  For example

G(FCC,FE:C,VA) is the interaction between C (carbon) and VA (vacant
interstitial sites) in the FCC phase.

The only binary excess model implemented in OC is the Redlish-Kister
Muggianu
\begin{eqnarray*}
L_{\rm A,B} = \sum_{\nu=0}^n  ~^{\nu}L_{\rm A,B} (y_{\rm A} - y_{\rm B})^{\nu}
\end{eqnarray*}
where the degree, $\nu$, of the interaction parameter is specified
after a semicolon, L(phase,A,B;$\nu$).

For ternary parameters and for reciprocal parameters the Hillert model
for composition dependence is implemented, see~\cite{07Luk}.

One can store many different types of data in OC using the parameter
identifier.  A description of the identifiers currently implemented
are explained in section~\ref{sc:paramid}

The current list can be obtained by the command {\bf LIST
  MODEL\_PARAM\_ID}.  All of them can be composition dependent.  Some
  cannot depend on $T$ or $P$ or neither.

Many parameters of the parameters are available but the models to
handle them are not yet implemented.

%--------------------------------
\subsection{{\em enter} Phase}
%\subsection{ENTER Phase}

%\subsubsection{Phase name:}

All thermodynamic data are connected to a phase as defined by its
parameters, see {\bf enter parameter}.  A phase has a name with can
contain letters, digits and the underscore character.  It must start
with a letter.

%\subsubsection{Model:}

After the phase name you must specify a model.  The model specfication
is implemented in a rather rudimentary way. The only recognized models
are

\begin{itemize}
\item IDEAL for a single lattice phase without interactions (like GAS)
\item RKM for a substitutional phase with interactions (like metallic
  liquid)
\item I2SL for the ionic liquid phase (2 sublattices with variable
  site ratios).  If the phase name is IONIC\_LIQUID this prompted as
  the default model.
\item CQC means the ``Corrected Quasichemical model'' for liquids.
\item CEF for any other phase with two or more sublattices
\end{itemize}

This list may be extended.  Many other model features like magnetism,
quasichemical etc is specified with the {\bf AMEND PHASE} command, see
section~\ref{sc:amendph}.  The AMEND PHASE command is also used to
specify disordered fraction set, low temperature CP model and many
other things.

%\subsubsection{Number of sublattices:}

%\subsubsection{Number of sites on sublattice }

For most models OC will ask for the number of sublattices and a phase
can have 1 to 9 sublattices and the user must for each specify the
number of sites.  For some models, like the ionic liquid model, the
number of sites may change with the composition of the phase so the
number specified is irrelevant.  See the book by Lukas et
al~\cite{07Luk} for more details on models.

%\subsubsection{Constituents:}
%\subsubsection{Sublattice constituents:}

For each sublattice the user must specify the constituents on the
sublattice.  A constituent that is not an element must already have
been entered as a species, see section~\ref{sc:entersp}.

The {\bf AMEND PHASE} command~\ref{sc:amendph} is used for some
additional model features like magnetism or permutations.

%--------------------------------
\subsection{{\em enter} Plot\_data}
%\subsection{ENTER Plot_data}

The user can add points to be plotted to a dataset 1 to 9.  The
dataset must already exist as a file opened by a command {\bf ENTER
  MANY\_EQUILIB}.

%--------------------------------
\subsection{{\em enter} Quit}
%\subsection{ENTER Quit}

Quit entering things.

%--------------------------------
\subsection{{\em enter} Species}\label{sc:entersp}
%\subsection{ENTER Species}

A species consists of a name and a stoichiometric formula.  It can have
a valence or charge.  The name is often the stoichiometric formula
but it does not have to be that.  Examples:

\begin{itemize}
\item enter species water h2o
\item enter species c2h2cl2\_trans c2h2cl2
\item enter species c2h2cl2\_cis c2h2cl2
\item enter species h+ h1/- -1
\end{itemize}

There can be a problem with ambiguity with a species name like h2o if
there is also a species h2o2.  In such cases use a final unity, i.e.
h2o1.

Single letter element names must be followed by a stoichiometric
factor unless it is the last element when 1 is assumed.  Two-letter
element names have by default the stoichiometric factor~1.

\begin{itemize}
\item enter species carbonmonoxide c1o1
\item enter species cobaltoxide coo
\item enter species carbondioxide c1o2
\end{itemize}

The species name is important as it is the name, not the
stoichiometry, that is used when referring to the species elsewhere
like as a phase constituent.  It is of course convenient to choose a
species name similar to its stoichiometric formula but as shown above,
that is not always sufficient.

%--------------------------------
\subsection{{\em enter} Symbol}
%\subsection{ENTER Symbol}

The OC package has both ``symbols'' and ``tpfun\_symbols'', the latter
has a very special syntax and can be used when entering parameters.

The symbols are designed to handle relations between state variables,
one can define expressions like \\
{\bf enter symbol KLBCR = X(LIQUID,CR)/X(BCC,CR);}\\
where KLBCR is set to the partition of the Cr mole fractions between
liquid and bcc.

The symbols also include ``dot derivatives'' like $H.T$ which is the
second derivative of the Gibbs energy with respect to the for the
current system at the given set of conditions.

{\bf enter symbol CP = H.T;}

If $T$ and $P$ are conditions and all other conditions are mass
balance conditions CP is the heat capacity.  It also takes account of
the change of configurational entropy.

Currently $H.T$ is the only dot derivatives allowed but more will be
added as soon as possible.

%--------------------------------
\subsection{{\em enter} Tpfun\_Symbol}
%\subsection{ENTER Tpfun_Symbol}

This symbol is an expression depending on $T$ and $P$ that can be used
when entering parameters.  A TPfun can refer to another TPfun.

TPFUNs have a strict syntax because the software must be able to fast
calculate first and second derivatives with respect to $T$ and $P$
during equilibrium calculations, see section~\ref{sc:tpfun}.

\subsection{{\em list} optimization result}
%\subsection{LIST Optimization}

Lists results of an optimization, several sub-options will be
implemented but currently there is a short version only.

%--------------------------------
\subsection{{\em list} Parameter}
%\subsection{LIST Parameter}

List a specific parameter.

%--------------------------------
\subsection{{\em list} Phase $<$\em phase$>$}
%\subsection{LIST Phase}

\subsection{{\em list} Results}
%\subsection{LIST Results}

List the results of an equilibrium calculation.  This is the most
frequent list command.  The listing will contain the current set of
conditions, a table with global data, a table with component specific
data and then a list of stable phases with amounts, compositions and
possibly constitutions.  It is possible to list also unstable phases.

There are 9 options for the formatting:
\begin{itemize}
\item 1 Output in mole fractions, phase constituents in value order
  (constituent with highest fraction first).
\item 2 as 1 but include also the phase constitution (sublattices and
  their fractions) in value order.
\item 3 as 1 with the phase composition in alphabetical order
\item 4 Output in mass fractions, phase composition in value order.
\item 5 as 4 with the phase composition in alphabetical order.
\item 6 as 4 and also include the phase constitutions in value order.
\item 7 Output all phases will with composition in mass fractions and
  in value order.  Unstable phases will have a negative driving force.
\item 8 Output all phases will with composition in mole fraction and
  constitution in alphabetic order.  Unstable phases will have a
  negative driving force.
\item 9 as 8 but in in value order.
\end{itemize}

For each phase the name, status (S/D/E/F), moles (or mass), volume,
number of formula units, atoms per formula units and driving force (in
dimensionless units) is given on one line.

The moles of a phase is the number of formula unit multiplied with
atoms per formula units.  The gas phase and phases with interstitials
and vacancies have a varying amount of moles of atoms per formula
units.  The composition of the phase can be in value order or
alphabetical order.

%--------------------------------
\subsection{{\em list} Short}
%\subsection{LIST Short}

There are 4 options: A/C/M/P

The A option lists a single line for each element, species and phase
with some essential data.

The C option lists the components and their data.

The M option lists the models and constitution for all phases.

The P option lists one line for each stable phase and then one line
for some of the remaining phases in decreasing order of stability.

%--------------------------------
\subsection{{\em list} State\_ Variables}\label{sc:list_statevar}
%\subsection{LIST State_Variables}

Values of individual state variables like G, HM(LIQUID), X(LIQUID,CR)
etc. can be listed.  Terminate the command by an empty line.  Note
that the values of symbols and TP functions cannot be listed here,
they are calculated by the CALCULATE SYMBOL or CALCULATE TP command.

The current values of parameter identifiers, see
section~\ref{sc:paramid} can be listed with the command, like TC(BCC)
will give the calculated Curie temperature for BCC.  A symbol like
MQ\&FE(FCC) will give the logarithm of the mobility of Fe in the FCC
phase.

%--------------------------------
\subsection{{\em list} Symbols}
%\subsection{LIST Symbols}

All state variable symbols listed but not their values, they are
calculated by the CALCULATE SYMBOL command.

\begin{verbatim}
List of all state variable symbols
 No Special Name= expression ;
  1         R= 8.31451;
  2         RT= R*T;
  3         T_C= T-273.15;
  4      X  CP= HM.T;
\end{verbatim}

In the ``special'' column the ``X'' means the symbol is calculated
only when explicitly specified.  There can also be a ``C'' indicating
a numeric value that can be amended or a number indicating in which
equilibrium the symbol is calculated.  See section~\ref{sc:amendsym}.

%--------------------------------
\subsection{{\em list} Tpfun Symbols}
%\subsection{LIST Tpfun_Symbols}

All or some TPFUN expressions listed.  By giving * all are listed,
bu giving the g* all TP functions starting with G are listed.

Note that all parameters are also TP functions, they can be listed by
giving ``\_*'' as name.  The abbreviation ``\_g*'' will list the
function for all parameters with identifiers starting with G.

To obtain the values of TP functions use the {\bf calculate TP}
command.

%===================================================================
\section{Macro }
%\section{Macro }

By specifying a file name commands will be read from that file.  The
default extension is OCM.  A macro file can open another macro file
(max 5 levels).  When a macro file finish with SET INTERACTIVE the
calling macro file will continue or the user can continue
interactively.

A macro file name can be given on the same line as the program and the
program will drictly start reading from this file.

%===================================================================
\section{Map }
%\section{Map }

For phase diagram calculations.  One must first set two axis with
state variables also set as conditions.

If one gives several MAP commands one can choose to erase or keep the
previous results.

During mapping each calculated equilibria is saved and different kinds
of calculated state variables can be used for plotting.

%===================================================================
\section{New }
%\section{New }

To remove all data so a new system can be entered.  It is fragile.

%===================================================================
\section{Optimize}
%\section{Optimize }

The model parameters selected by SET VARIABLE\_COEFF will be varied to
obtain the best least square fit the experimental data provided.

Before this command the user must have entered the thermodynamic
descriptions of the phases with model parameters depending on
optimizing coefficients and the experimental data.  He must also set
the range and weights of the experiments and which coefficents to
vary.

The user provides a maximum number of iterations allowed.

Developing better assessment software is one of the main aspects of
the OC software.  There will be more options to this command soon.

%===================================================================
\section{Plot }
%\section{Plot }

Plot the result from a STEP or MAP calculation.  A simple interface to
GNUPLOT~\cite{gnuplot} has been implemented in OC.  This generates a
command file which is later plotted using GNUPLOT.

In OC you must first specify the state variable on the horizontal
(x-axis) and vertical (y-axis) axis.  Then you can give several of the
options below, finish with RENDER or QUIT.

If you plot the same calculation several times the plot options you
set (scaling, text, etc) will be kept unless you change the state
variables to be plotted on the axis. If you do that these options will
be reset to default values.

Default plotfile is ``ocgnu.plt''.  This is the command file which
will be executed by GNUPLOT.  If GNUPLOT is correctly installed OC
will start GNUPLOT and generate the graphics output when you RENDER
the plot.

GNUPLOT is a very powerful graphics software, only a few of these are
available by OC.  The gnuplot command file generated by OC can be
edited to exploit additional facilities in GNUPLOT.

You can APPEND a GNUPLOT command file generated by OC, or manually
edited, in a new plot.

\subsection{{\em set} Advanced}
%\subsection{SET Advanced}

A few options implemented

%.............................................................
\subsubsection{{\em set advanced} dense grid onoff}
%\subsection{SET Advanced DENSE_GRID_ONOFF}

This toggles the grid minimizer to use/not use a denser grid (about 10
times more gridpoints) when generating start values for the interactive
minimizer.  It can be useful when the normal grid is too coarse to
detect some miscibility gaps or order/disorder transitions.  It takes
about 10 times longer to calculate.

%--------------------------------
\subsection{{\em set} As start equilibrium}
%\subsection{SET As start equilibrium}

for STEP and MAP commands.

%--------------------------------
\subsection{{\em set} Axis}
%\subsection{SET Axis}

A condition can be set as an axis variable with a low and high limit
and a maximum increment.  With 2 or more axis one will calculate a
phase diagram, i.e. lines where the set of stable phases changes.

With one axis one calculates the set of stable phases and their
properties while changing the axis variable.

%--------------------------------
\subsection{{\em set} Bit}
%\subsection{SET Bit}

Many records have status words where the bits are used to signify
different things.  An advanced user can set these bits for the global,
equilibrium and phase records, but only if you know what it means.
\begin{itemize}
\item The global record bits are listed below.  Most of them are
  set or reset automatically by the software or by other commands.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item   0  you are a beginner (set by default)
  \item   1  you are experienced
  \item   2  you are an expert
  \item   3  gridminimizer must not be used
  \item   4  gridminimizer must not merge comp.sets. (set by default)
  \item   5  there are no data (cleread automatically)
  \item   6  there are no phases (cleared automatically)
  \item   7  comp.sets must not be created automatically
  \item   8  comp.sets must not be deleted automatically
  \item   9  data has changed since last save (set automtically)
  \item  10  means verbose is on (not implemented)
  \item  11  means verbose is permanently on (not implemented)
  \item  12  means be silent (supress warnings)
  \item  13  no cleanup after an equilibrium calculation
  \item  14  use denser grid in grid minimizer (see also ADVANCED)
  \item  15  calculations in parallel is not allowed
  \end{itemize}
%--------------------------------------------------------------
\item The EQUILIBRIUM record bits are listed below
  \begin{itemize}
  \item   0  No threads allowed (no parallel calculation)
  \item   1  No global minimization allowed for this equilibrium
  \item   2  No equilibrium has been calculated (there are no results)
  \item   3  Conditions and results not consistent
  \item   4  Last equilibrium calculation failed
  \item   5  No automatic generation of composition sets
  \item   6  Equilibrium tested by grid minimizer
  \item   7  Current results are from a grid minimization
  \end{itemize}
%--------------------------------------------------------------
\item To change the phase status word use SET PHASE ... bit
\end{itemize}
%--------------------------------
\subsection{{\em set} Condition}
%\subsection{SET Condition}

A condition is a value assigned to a state variable or an expression
of state variables.  By setting the status of a phase to fix one has
also set a condition.

Two cases of expressions can be used as conditions, for example a
relation between mole fraction like\\
{\bf set condition x(liq,o)-x(c1\_mo2,o)=0}\\
means that the oxygen content in liquid and c1\_mo2 phases should be the
same.  That is useful to calculate the congruent melting of c1\_mo2.

Another case is if the total anount if some components has a relation,
for example:\\ 
{\bf set condition n(u)+n(zr)=1}\\ 
means that the total number of moles of the components U and Zr should
be unity.
%--------------------------------
\subsection{{\em set} Echo}
%\subsection{SET Echo}

This is useful command in macro files or when demonstrating the program.

%--------------------------------
\subsection{{\em set} Fixed coefficient}
%\subsection{SET Fixed coefficient}

An optimizing coefficient is assigned a fixed value.

%--------------------------------
\subsection{{\em set} Input Amounts}
%\subsection{SET Input\_Amounts}

This allows the user to specify a system by giving a redundant amount
of various species in the system.  The software will transform this to
conditions on the amounts of the components.

%--------------------------------
\subsection{{\em set} Interactive}
%\subsection{SET Interactive}

The last command on a macro file.  Gives command back to the keyboard
of the user, or to the calling macro file.  Without this the program
will just terminate when the macro is finished.

%--------------------------------
\subsection{{\em set} Level}
%\subsection{SET Level}

I am no longer sure what this should do and if it is needed ...

%--------------------------------
\subsection{{\em set} Log\_File}
%\subsection{SET Log\_File}

A useful command to save all interactive input while running OC.  The
log file can easily be transformed to a macro file.  All bug reports
should be accompanied by a log file which reproduces the bug.

%--------------------------------
\subsection{{\em set} Numeric\_Options}
%\subsection{SET Numeric\_Options}

The default number of iterations and accuracy can be specified.
Default values are 500 and 10$^{-6}$.

%--------------------------------
\subsection{{\em set} Optimizing conditions}
%\subsection{SET Optimizing conditions}

A few variables used to guide the optimization of model parameters can
be set.

%--------------------------------
\subsection{{\em set} Phase}
%\subsection{SET Phase}

You must specify a phase name.  Some phase specific things can be set,
also for the model.

%....................
\subsubsection{{\em set phase} ... Amount}
%\subsubsection{SET PHASE ... Amount}

One can specify the amount of the phase which is used as initial value
for an equilibrium calculation.

%....................
\subsubsection{{\em set phase} ... Bits}
%\subsubsection{SET PHASE ... Bits}

Some of the models and data storage depend on the bits of the phase.
Note that most of them are set automatically by the software and
changing them with this command may not have the expected effect.  The
bits are:

\begin{itemize}
%\subsubsubsection{EXTRA_DENSE_GROD}
\item EXTRA\_DENSE\_GRID makes it possible to have a larger number of
  gridpoints calculated for this phase by the gridminimizer.

%. . . . . . . . . .
%\subsubsubsection{NO_AUTO_COMP_SET}
\item NO\_AUTO\_COMP\_SET.  This makes it possible to prevent that a
specific phase has automatic composition set created during
calculations.

%. . . . . . . . . .
%\subsubsubsection{QUIT}
\item OUIT, do not set any more bits.
\end{itemize}

%....................
\subsubsection{{\em set phase} ... Constitution}
%\subsubsection{SET PHASE ... CONSTITUTION}

This is the same as {\bf amend phase constitution}.

%....................
\subsubsection{{\em set phase} ... Default\_constitu}
%\subsubsection{SET PHASE ... DEFAULT_CONSTITU}

Same as {\bf amend phase default\_constit}.

%....................
\subsubsection{{\em set phase} ... Quit}
%\subsubsection{SET PHASE ... Quit}

You did not want to set anything for the phase.

%....................
\subsubsection{{\em set phase} ... Status}
%\subsubsection{SET PHASE ... STATUS}

Use the SET STATUS PHASE command to set the status of several phases.
The different status are explained there.

%--------------------------------
\subsection{{\em set} Quit}
%\subsection{SET Quit}

You did not really want to set anything.

%--------------------------------
\subsection{{\em set} Range of experimental equilibria}\label{sc:enterrange}
%\subsection{SET Range_exper_ equ}\label{sc:enterrange}

For an assessment several consquetive equilibria with experimental
data must be entered.  This command specifies the first and last of
those equilibria.  It possible to add more equilibria later one by
one (not yet though).  

The equilibria are assigned weight one by default.  The weight can be
changed with the SET WEIGHT command.

%--------------------------------
\subsection{{\em set} Reference\_State}\label{sc:setref}
%\subsection{SET Reference\_State}

By default the reference state for the components is SER (Stable
Element Reference) which is the stable state of the element at
298.15~K and 1~bar.  (NOTE: in principle SER is defined by the database
but today almost all databases have SER as reference state.)

For each component (also for other components than the elements) one
can specify a phase at a given temperature and pressure as reference
state.  The phase must exist for the component as pure.  Instead of a
fixed $T$ one can give a *, indicating current $T$, if one calculates
at different values of $T$.  Example:

{\bf set reference O gas * 1e5}

Note that state variables like the chemical potential, MU(O), will
refer to the user defined reference state.  To obtain the value for
the SER state one can use the suffix S, i.e. MUS(O) will give the
chemical potential refered to SER.

NOTE also that the value of integral properties like Gibbs energy,
$G$, enthalpy, $H$, etc. will always be given relative SER unless all
components have the same phase as reference state.  Thus in order to
have the enthalpy of mixing of a phase all components must have that
phase as reference state.

%--------------------------------
\subsection{{\em set} Scaled coefficient}
%\subsection{SET Scaled coefficient}

A coefficient for optimization can be specified with a start value,
scaling factor and a minimum and maximum value.  The {\em set} VARIABLE
command sets the scaling factor equal to the start value and have no
min or max values.

%--------------------------------
\subsection{{\em set} Status}
%\subsection{SET Status}

The status of elements, constituents, species or phases can be
changed.  Only phases are implemented.

%....................
\subsubsection{{\em set status} Constituent}
%\subsubsection{SET STATUS Constituent}

A constituent of a phase can be suspended.  Not yet implemented.

%....................
\subsubsection{{\em set status} Element}
%\subsubsection{SET STATUS Element}

An element can be ENTERED or SUSPENDED.  If an element is suspended
all species with this element is automatically suspended.  Not yet
implemented.

%....................
\subsubsection{{\em set status} Phase}
%\subsubsection{SET STATUS Phase}

A phase can have 4 status

\begin{itemize}
\item entered, this is the default.  The phase will be stable if that
would give the most stable state for the current conditions.  The user
can give a tentative amount.
\item suspended, the phase will not be included in any calculations.
\item dormant, the phase will be included in the calculations but will
not be allowed to become stable even if that would give the most
stable equilibrium.  In such a case the phase will have a positive
driving force.
\item fixed means that it is a condition that the phase is stable with
the specified amount.  Note that for solution phases the composition
is not known.
\end{itemize}

You can use a list of phase names or a wildcard for the phase name and
the must give an equal sign, ``='', before the new status.  You can
also use the special ``*S'' for all suspended phase, ``*D'' for all
dormant phases.

Changing the phase status does not affect anything except the phase
itself.  For a single phase you can use SET PHASE ... STATUS $<$status$>$.

Setting a stable phase as dormant or suspended and calculate the
equilibrium will give you a metastable equilibrium.

Setting a phase status as FIXED means it is a condition that this
phase should be stable.  Setting the liquid fix with the amount zero
is a quick way to calculate the melting temperature of a system if
there is no condition on the T.

%....................
\subsubsection{{\em set status} Species}
%\subsubsection{SET STATUS Species}

A species can be ENTERED or SUSPENDED.  If a species is suspended
all phases that have this as single constituent in a sublattice
will be automatically suspended.  Not yet implemented.

%--------------------------------
\subsection{{\em set} T\_and\_P}
%\subsection{SET T and P}

Local values of T and P can be set.  These are not conditions but are
used for commands like {\bf CALCULATE PHASE ...}.

%--------------------------------
\subsection{{\em set} Units}
%\subsection{SET Units}

For each property the unit can be specified like Kelvin, Farenheit or
Celsius for temperature.  Not implemented yet.

Equilibria with weight zero will be ignored in an optimization.  

You can specify the current equilibrium or give an abbreviation that
will set the weight of all equilibria with a name for which the
abbreviation fits.

%===================================================================
\section{Step }
%\section{Step }

Requires that a single axis is set.  If a second step command is given
you have the choice of deleting or keeping the previous results.

%--------------------------------
\subsection{{\em step} Conditional}
%\subsection{STEP Conditional}

A specified symbol is evaluated at each step.  Can be used for
Scheil-Gulliver solidification simulation when implemented.

%--------------------------------
\subsection{{\em step} Normal}
%\subsection{STEP Normal}

Calculates equilibria from the low axis limit to the high at each
increment.  The exact axis value for any phase changes is calculated.

%--------------------------------
\subsection{{\em step} Quit}
%\subsection{STEP Quit}

You did not want to {\em step}.

%--------------------------------
\subsection{{\em step} Separate}
%\subsection{{\em step} Separate}

Calculates each phase separately.  It calculates equilibria for each
phase separately.  It can be used to calculate Gibbs energy curves.

\section{Summary }
%\section{Summary }

That's all and I hope enough (when all is implemented).  Have fun and
report all errors or problems providing a macro file and the necessary
data.
